        <p>The Canadian school system is known for its high quality and inclusivity, providing free public education from kindergarten through grade 12. It is divided into early childhood education, primary education (grades 1-6), and secondary education (grades 7-12).</p>
        <p>The two official languages of Canada are English and French. In most of Canada, English is the main language of school-level education, although French is seen heavily throughout. In the province of Quebec, however, students are required to attend school fully in French until they complete their high school studies, and only under certain special circumstances may a Canadian student study in English, for example those that are in Quebec for a temporary period of time.</p>

            <p>In British Columbia, students don't receive traditional letter grades until high school. Instead, their report cards use terms like "Emerging," "Developing," "Proficient," or "Extending" to describe their progress. This approach focuses on individual growth and learning rather than just numerical scores.</p>
