        <p>China's education system is renowned for its rigorous academic standards and deep-rooted cultural traditions. China has the largest  education system in the world. In June 2024, there were 13.53 million students taking the National Higher Education Entrance Examination - <span class="Span_bold">Gao Kao</span> in China.</p>
        <p>The Chinese educational structure provides for six years of primary school, three years each of lower secondary school and upper secondary school, and four years in the standard university curriculum. All urban schools are financed by the state, while rural schools depend more heavily on their own financial resources.</p>
        <p>On average, primary school pupils spend about seven to eight hours at school whilst a secondary school student spends about twelve to fourteen hours at school if including lunchtime and evening classes. Due to the fierce competitiveness to get into good universities, the pressure to do well for Gao Kao is intense.</p>
