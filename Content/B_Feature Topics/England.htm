        <p>The education system in the UK is divided into four main parts; primary education, secondary education, further education and higher education.<br /></p>
        <p>It is also split into "key stages" based upon the student's age, which breaks down as follows:<br /></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Key Stage 1: 5 to 7 years old</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Key Stage 2: 7 to 11 years old</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Key Stage 3: 11 to 14 years old</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Key Stage 4: 14 to 16 years old</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

                <p><span class="Span_bold">Uniforms</span>: The school system in England is rich with traditions and unique features that make it stand out. One of the most notable aspects is the requirement for students to wear uniforms. These uniforms, which vary widely in style and color, help promote a sense of community and equality among students. The sight of neatly dressed students in their school uniforms is a quintessential part of the English educational experience.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Span_bold">School Houses</span>: Another interesting feature is the house system, which is prevalent in many schools across England. Students are divided into groups called "houses," and these houses compete in various activities and events throughout the school year. This system fosters teamwork, school spirit, and a healthy sense of competition. It's not uncommon for students to develop a strong sense of loyalty and pride towards their house.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Span_bold">Boarding Schools</span>: England is also home to some of the world's most famous boarding schools, such as Eton College and Harrow School. These institutions have a long history and have educated many notable figures, including British prime ministers and members of the royal family. Boarding schools in England are known for their rigorous academic programs and rich traditions, making them a unique aspect of the country's educational landscape.</p>
