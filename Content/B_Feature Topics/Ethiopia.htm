        <p>Formal education consists of in total 12 grades. Primary school education consists of two cycles: grades 1 to 4 and 5 to 8. Secondary schools also have two cycles: grades 9 to 10 and 11 to 12. Primary schools have over 90% of 7-year-olds enrolled although only about half complete both cycles. This situation varies from one region to the other, being lower in agro-pastoral locations (such as Somali and Afar regions) and the growing regions such as Gambela and Benshangul Gumuz.</p>
        <p>Despite significant progress in expanding access to education, Ethiopia faces challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, limited resources, and disparities in educational quality, particularly in rural areas. The government continues to implement initiatives and policies to address these issues and improve educational outcomes for all students.</p>
