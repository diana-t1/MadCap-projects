        <p>The school system in Iran is centralized and divided into several key stages, overseen by the Ministry of Education. Education is compulsory for children from ages 6 to 18, and it is divided into primary education, junior high school, and senior high school.</p>
        <p>In Iran, all schools are single-sex, meaning boys and girls attend separate schools. From primary school through to high school, boys and girls are educated in separate institutions. This separation is intended to create a focused learning environment and to respect the cultural norms regarding gender interactions. Despite the separation, both boys' and girls' schools follow the same national curriculum and aim to provide a high-quality education to all student.</p>

            <p>In Iran, the school week runs from Saturday to Wednesday, with Thursday and Friday being the weekend. This schedule is different from many other countries where the weekend typically includes Saturday and Sunday. This unique arrangement allows for a continuous five-day school week, followed by a two-day break, aligning with the country's cultural and religious practices.</p>
